- Define the `GET` vs `POST` HTTP methods
- Write HTML `form` data elements

## Introduction

Up to this point, all of the HTML elements we've seen are used to display data
_to_ users. This is great, but what happens when we want to get information
_from_ our users? In order to get user information, we need to write HTML forms.
We will learn to write them in this lesson.

## Identify the Purpose of a Form

Forms gather user information. They're just like surveys you might fill out at
a supermarket or a questionnaire you'd fill out at the doctor's office.

Let's suppose that you're the owner of a dog walking business that needs a way
to gather information from clients. You would use an HTML form to collect
information like:

* owner's name
* owner's address
* dog's name
* dog's age
* walking frequency

You collect this information in HTML tags called `input`s located within the
`form` tag. You will also code a "Submit" button so the client can say "OK! I'm
done!" We'll discuss `input`s in more detail below.

When the owner fills out the form's inputs and clicks "Submit," a record of
their responses will be sent to a server where the information can be stored.
Once the server has the information stored, software can be written to use the
server's information to create newsletters, login accounts, or invitations to
client-appreciation parties.

To store the information, we need a language like Ruby, PHP, or Java.  We won't
be covering storage and usage in this lesson. Writing code to handle things
like that is "_back-end engineering_." Luckily, all those languages are
designed to receive the information sent by an HTML `form`.

Let's write an HTML form. We'll use the `form` tag.

## Write an HTML Form Tag

The starting element in an HTML form is the `<form>` tag. The `form` element
wraps all the `input` elements that will collect our users' information inside
of them. We will cover `input` elements in great detail after finishing
discussing the attributes within a `form` tag.

The `form` tag's first attribute, `action`, decides where the user information
is sent. This is typically the URL of a server. This server will run the Ruby,
PHP, or Java (or other!) code required to store the information the `form`
sends.

The second attribute, `method`, sets the _HTTP method_ the browser will use to
send the user information to the server. You can think of "_HTTP method_" as
being like an envelope type. Some envelopes are good for documents, others are
good for confidential letters, and yet others are good for overseas mail. The
_HTTP methods_ used in forms are `GET` and `POST`.

While you won't write the "back-end" code here, we'll describe what you see as
a user when an HTML author chooses `GET` versus `POST`.

## Define The `GET` vs. `POST` HTTP Methods

### GET

Below we see the `form` example code for making a `GET` request.

```html
<form action="http://example.com/process-user.php" method="GET">
  <input type="text" name="owner-name">
  <input type="text" name="dog-name">
  <input type="text" name="favorite-toy">
  <input type="submit" value="submit">
</form>
```

When the user clicks the submit button, their responses in the `input` fields
are captured and labeled using the `name` attributes from each element. The
browser stores this information behind the scenes like this:

`owner-name=Bob+Barkley&dog-name=SirBarksALot&favorite-toy=ball`

This is known as the _Query String_. The browser _then_ attaches the _Query
String_ onto the location listed in the `form`'s `action` attribute after a `?`
to create a URL that looks like this:

`http://example.com/process-user.php?owner-name=Bob+Barkley&dog-name=SirBarksALot&favorite-toy=ball`

The browser then goes to this new URL. The server then uses _back-end
programming_ to use the information in the _Query String_ to change what it
will show.

When a _Query String_ is added to a URL, it's a **great** solution for
filtering the information that comes back. Forms are a nice way for users to
add those filters without typing them in by hand. You've probably seen this on
the internet.

![Amazon Using a Form with GET](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/web-development/html-forms/amazon_get_request.png)

Here, Amazon uses a `form` tag with `method` of `GET` to filter their *huge*
store. They filter based on matches of the
`<input type="text" name="field-keywords">`. We typed in "dog toys" into that
text field input.

While this is a great method for things like search, this is bad for passwords,
obviously! A _Query String_ with `password=ByronBestPoodle` will stand out!
When you need to send your response in a way that doesn't leak information, you
want your form to use the `POST` _HTTP method_.

> **ADVANCED**: An advanced concept is that a `GET` request is "idempotent."
> That means the browser can run it repeatedly without changing information on
> the back-end. We can ask for a filtered list of dog toys again and again and
> again by hitting Refresh again and again and again. Nothing changes on the
> server if we do that.

### POST

Below we see the same form example code for making a POST request.

```html
<form action="http://example.com/process-user.php" method="POST">
  <input type="text" name="owner-name">
  <input type="text" name="dog-name">
  <input type="text" name="favorite-toy">
  <input type="submit" value="submit">
</form>
```

It's the same form you would write for a `GET`-method `form`, but with the
`method` attribute changed.

When the user clicks the submit button, their responses in the `input` fields
are captured and labeled using the `name` attributes from each element. The
browser stores this information like this:

`owner-name=Bob+Barkley&dog-name=SirBarksALot&favorite-toy=ball`

A `POST` is like a secure envelope. We can't see the information being sent.
That's why `POST` is the right call when sending sensitive information like
passwords or national IDs. The user's browser **is not redirected** in this
case. We can't show you a screenshot of what this looks like because, well,
there's nothing to show. Usually, after a successful POST, the web site will
send you to a page that says "Thanks for your purchase" or "Thanks for joining
our site."

> **ADVANCED**: An advanced concept is that a `POST` request is **not**
> "idempotent." If the browser runs it repeatedly, it **will** change data on
> the back end. Submitting payment for a credit card is **not** idempotent.
> Each refresh will take money out of your bank account! That's why many
> finance sites say "Don't refresh this page while we process your request."

Now that we know how to write a `form` tag and we understand the HTTP action
that goes in its `action` attribute, let's talk about different ways we can ask
for information within our `form` by choosing the right `input`.

## Write HTML Form Data Elements

What _is_ an `input`?

Think about a doctor's questionnaire: sometimes they ask you to
fill-in-the-blank, sometimes they ask you to mark checkboxes next to symptoms,
and other times they ask you to write a short answer. They ask all these
different _types_ of questions within the same questionnaire or _form_. All of
those types of questionnaire prompts have a cousin in an HTML `input`. A
fill-in-the-blank is an `<input type="text">`. A short essay's twin is `<input
type="textarea">`.

The rest of this lesson will be spent introducing you to the `input` elements.

### Text Field Input

Creating an `input` tag with `type="text"` gives our users a place to type
in a single line of text. It looks like this:

`<input type="text" name="owner-name" placeholder="Full Name"> `

The `placeholder` attribute puts some dummy text into the element. That text
will be replaced when the user starts filling it in. The `name` attribute
gives our input a name.

Here's a screenshot:

<img src="https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/web-development/fewds-html-forms/textfield_input.png" alt="Image of textfield input">

Generally, HTML form attributes should not contain spaces. Common exceptions to
this rule are `placeholder` and `class`. If you're not sure whether or not your
attribute can contain a space, check out [this article][article].

### A Note on Labels

You might have noticed we sneaked an extra tag in, the `label` tag. When
writing forms, we don't want to describe what goes in the form by using `p`
tags. We can more meaningfully "tie" descriptive text (that is, a label) to an
input field using the `label` tag. The `name` attribute of the `input` is
provided to the `label`'s `for` attribute and the browser knows to put them
close to each other.

Labels are not strictly necessary on HTML forms. **But** they make our site
better for those using assistive devices. It's the Right Thing to Do.

Why do we put _both_ labels _and_ placeholders? First, not all browsers and
assistive devices support placeholder attributes. Labels help assistive devices
help users who need them more easily enter data. Again, it's part of our desire
to create an inclusive and accessible web.

### Password Inputs

Creating an `input` tag with `type="password"` gives our users a place to type
information that will _not_ be displayed by the browser. Most of the time
browsers put `*` or dots instead of the character. This is useful when private
information is entered, so your password isn't displayed for others to see.

```html
<label for="password">What's the password?</label>
<input type="password" name="password" placeholder="Enter your password here">
```

Here's a screenshot:

<img src="https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/web-development/fewds-html-forms/password_input.png" alt="Image of password input">

### Telephone Inputs

Creating an `input` tag with `type="tel"` behaves like a text field, but will
bring up the numeric keypad on supported mobile devices.

```html
<label for="tel">Where should E.T. &trade; Phone Home?</label>
<input id="tel" type="tel" name="phone" placeholder="Phone Number">
```

Here's a screenshot:

<img src="https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/web-development/fewds-html-forms/tel_input.png" alt="Image of tel input">

### Submit Inputs

Creating an `input` tag with `type="submit"` creates a submit button that, when
clicked, will do something with a user's `form` data.  The `value` attribute
holds the text that will appear on the button.

```html
<input type="submit" value="Let me walk your dog!">
```

Here's a screenshot:

<img src="https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/web-development/fewds-html-forms/submit_input.png" alt="Image of submit input">

### Radio Inputs

Radio inputs show users many options. But radio buttons allow users to select
only one. You will set different `value` attributes for each radio button, but
they _must_ have the same `name` attribute.

```html
<h3>Does your dog get along with other dogs?</h3>
<input type="radio" name="plays-well-with-others" value="high"> The more dogs, the better!<br>
<input type="radio" name="plays-well-with-others" value="medium"> It depends on the dog, but generally they are ok<br>
<input type="radio" name="plays-well-with-others" value="low"> My dog prefers their walkies solo<br>
```

Here's a screenshot:

<img src="https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/web-development/fewds-html-forms/radio_input.png" alt="Image of radio input">

### Checkboxes

Checkboxes are like radio buttons...but you can choose more than one.

```html
<h3>What are your dogs favorite toys?</h3>
<input type="checkbox" name="toy-1" value="kong"> Kong <br>
<input type="checkbox" name="toy-2" value="stuffed-animals">Stuffed Animals<br>
<input type="checkbox" name="toy-3" value="rope-toys">Rope Toys<br>
<input type="checkbox" name="toy-4" value="squeaky-toys">Squeaky Toys<br>
<input type="checkbox" name="toy-5" value="balls">Balls, Frisbees, anything a dog can fetch!<br>
```

Here's a screenshot:

<img src="https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/web-development/fewds-html-forms/checkbox_input.png" alt="Image of the checkbox input">

### Select Menus

This is pretty advanced!

Select menus create a drop-down menu. Inside the `select` tag you use `option`
tags to create a menu. Inside the `option` tag you say what will be shown in
the menu. In the `value` option you say what will be sent as part of the _Query
String_. For the example below the _Query String_ would contain `size="small"`.

```html
<h3>What size is your dog?</h3>
<select name="size">
  <option value="small" selected>Small(0-25 pounds)</option>
  <option value="medium">Medium (26-50 pounds)</option>
  <option value="large">Large (51-75 pounds)</option>
  <option value="x-large">Extra Large (over 75 pounds)</option>
</select>
```

Here's a screenshot:

<img src="https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/web-development/fewds-html-forms/select_input.png" alt="Image of select input">

### Textarea

Textarea elements are useful if we want our users to be able to write
multiple lines of text. For example, if we wish to allow our clients to write
special notes for their dogs, we can let them write as much or as little as they
like.

```html
<h3>Any other things we should know about your dog?</h3>
<textarea name="message"></textarea>
```

Here's a screenshot:

<img src="https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/web-development/fewds-html-forms/textarea_input.png" alt="Image of textarea input">

## Summary

We use HTML `form`s to collect data from users. Start with a form element. Give
it an `action` and `method`, probably `POST`. Inside the `form` add several
`input` elements. Use the best `input` for the data you're requesting. Make
sure that your `input`s are clearly labeled. If you follow these guidelines
you'll soon be getting all the user data you can handle!
